			<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and
				typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard
				dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a
				galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has
				survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
				typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</p>
